I am not a programmer and I have very basic coding skills. 

The contents of this folder are the scripts that I used to analyze lionfish RAD-seq data for my dissertation and the following publication:


Bors EK, Herrera S, Morris JA, Shank TM (2019). Population Genomics of Rapidly Invading Lionfish in the Caribbean Reveals Signals of 
Range Expansion in the Absence of Spatial Population Structure. Ecology and Evolution. 

Please contact me with questions but also please be advised that the files in this directory contain some pretty ugly code!
